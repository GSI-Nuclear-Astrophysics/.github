## 🔬 About Us
We are an experimental research group dedicated to investigating the origins of the elements in the universe. Our work primarily takes place at the world-class **GSI/FAIR storage ring facilities (ESR and CRYRING)**. 

Our research focuses on:
*   **Nucleosynthesis:** Studying the r-process and p-process through experimental reaction studies.
*   **Mass Spectrometry:** High-precision mass measurements of short-lived nuclei.
*   **Storage Ring Physics:** Developing novel experimental techniques for stored highly charged ions.
*   **Nuclear Spectroscopy:** Investigating half-lives and decay modes in extreme environments.

## 📖 For Group Members
Are you new to the group? Welcome aboard! 
Please head over to our **[Group Handbook](https://github.com/GSI-Nuclear-Astrophysics/group-handbook)** repository. It contains:
*   💻 **Software Guidelines:** Our coding standards and Git workflow.
*   📚 **Tutorials:** Guides on data analysis and using GSI computing clusters.
*   🛠 **Onboarding:** Everything you need to get started at GSI.

## 🚀 Software & Open Source
We believe in open, reproducible science. Our group develops and maintains several toolkits for nuclear data analysis, primarily in **Python** and **C++**.

*   **[RionID](https://github.com/GSI-Nuclear-Astrophysics/rionid):** Identification of ringed ions in storage rings.
*   **[TDMchopS](https://github.com/GSI-Nuclear-Astrophysics/tdmchops):** High-precision analysis of Schottky signals.
*   **[RionMass](https://github.com/GSI-Nuclear-Astrophysics/RionMass):** Toolkit for mass measurements using the CMM method.
